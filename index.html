                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <p>
                In a blender, mix the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and stir with a spoon. Pour the batter into cupcake liners placed in a large baking pan, side by side. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until baked and golden. Remove and let cool. <br><br>
                For the filling, cook all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until thickened. Turn off the heat, let it cool, and place the mixture into a piping bag with a round tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream into another piping bag with a star tip and set aside. <br><br>
                To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill it with the coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the tops with the whipped cream in circular motions. Garnish with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
